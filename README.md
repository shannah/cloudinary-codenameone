# Cloudinary Codename One

This library adds support for the [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) image management service to [Codename One](http://www.codenameone.com) apps.  The library itself is a direct port of the [Cloudinary Java SDK](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration).

## Supported Platforms

Should work on all platforms that Codename One apps can be deployed to:

* iOS
* Android
* BlackBerry
* Windows Phone
* JavaSE / Desktop /Simulator
* HTML5

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release of cloudinary-codenameone.cn1lib](https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone/releases/latest) and copy it into your project's "lib" directory.
2. Download [BouncyCastleCN1Lib.cn1lib](https://github.com/chen-fishbein/bouncy-castle-codenameone-lib/raw/master/BouncyCastleCN1Lib.cn1lib) and copy it into your project's "lib" directory.
2. Select "Codename One" > "Refresh Libs"

## Configuration

Refer to the [Cloudinary Java Integration Guide's Configuration Section](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration#configuration) for configuration information.  

My preferred configuration in a Codename One app is to place the following inside my app's `init()` method:

```java
import com.cloudinary.Cloudinary;

...
Cloudinary cloudinary;

...

public void init() {

    ...
    
    Cloudinary cloudinary = new Cloudinary(ObjectUtils.asMap(
      "cloud_name", "my_cloud_name",
      "api_key", "my_api_key",
      "api_secret", "my_api_secret"));
      
      
    // Disable private CDN URLs as this doesn't seem to work with free accounts
    cloudinary.config.privateCdn = false;
    
    ...
}
```

## Documentation

* [JavaDocs](http://shannah.github.io/cloudinary-codenameone/javadoc/)
* [Cloudinary Java Integration Guide](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration) - Most of this should be applicable to the Codename One Library
* [Cloudinary Documentation Main Page](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/)

## Building from Source

Check out the source from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone.git
```

This project is missing the following files that you will need to copy from another NetBeans codename One project.

* JavaSE.jar
* lib/CLDC11.jar
* lib/CodenameOne.jar
* lib/CodenameOne_src.zip
* CodenameOneBuildClient.jar

Once you have copied all of these files into the project, you can just open the project in Netbeans and build it.  

If you run the project it will load a minimal demo app in the simulator that uses Cloudinary.  You'll need to adjust the cloudinary credentials [here](https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone/blob/master/src/com/codename1/cloudinary/CloudinaryDemo.java#L28) to match your cloudinary account for the demo to work.

If you build the project, you will find the built cn1lib file at dist/cloudinary-codenameone.cn1lib
